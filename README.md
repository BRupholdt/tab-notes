# Tab Notes

Chrome extension that opens a new notepad in place of every new tab. Unlike most similar apps, this one lets users keep as many different notes as they like ðŸ˜…

Highlights:
- Unique note in each tab, retrieved via ID in hash
- Access list of all notes from popup
- Offline & private, saved in localStorage
- Export notes into a plaintext JSON file with one click
- First line is the tab title
- Favicon changes based on amount of text
- No permissions
- Not elegant, but it works
- Pure javascript, without bulky frameworks
- Needs lots of refactoring
